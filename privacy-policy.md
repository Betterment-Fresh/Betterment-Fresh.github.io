# Privacy Policy - Betterment Fresh

**Effective Date:** 16/08/25

Betterment Fresh ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our mobile applications.


## Information Collection and Use

Our Tickchick application:
- **Stores usage data locally** on your device only, including:
  - Tasks you create and their completion status
  - Timer session statistics (completed sessions, focus time)
  - App settings and preferences
- **Does not send personal data** to our servers
- **Does not track user behavior** for advertising or analytics purposes
- **Does not collect identifiable information** such as names, email addresses, or phone numbers

## Third-Party Integrations (Optional)

Tickchick offers optional integrations that you can choose to enable:

**Todoist Integration**: If you connect your Todoist account, we sync task data between Tickchick and Todoist using their official API. This data exchange is governed by [Todoist's Privacy Policy](https://todoist.com/privacy).

## App Permissions

Tickchick requests the following permissions:
- **Notifications:** To alert you when timers complete
- **Vibration:** To provide haptic feedback for timer alerts  
- **Internet:** Only for optional Todoist and LIFX integrations (when enabled by you)
- **Foreground Service:** To continue running timers when the app is in background

## Data Security

All your personal data (tasks, statistics, preferences) is stored locally on your device using Android's secure storage mechanisms. We do not have access to this data.

## Third-Party Services

Our app is distributed through Google Play Store, which may collect device and usage information according to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Future Updates

We plan to add crash reporting (Firebase Crashlytics) in future updates to help improve app stability. When implemented, only technical crash data will be collected - no personal information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Effective Date."
